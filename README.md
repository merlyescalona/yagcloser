# YAGCloser

**Y**et **A**nother **G**ap **C**loser based on long Reads


## Introduction

A program for correction of genome assemblies focused on gap closing and filling, starting from long-reads, and based on overelapping reads, lenght agreement and a lenient consensus.

## TODO: 
yagloser

test data
simulation 
assembly
make arbitrary gaps of arbitrary lengths
different coverages
how well they are closed
how the consensus sequences are

simuated
bioinformatics application notes
